 *
 * Signifies which class represents the "public interface" of the annotated class, where "public interface" is a
 * publicly exported type intended for consumption by developers. This annotation is meant to be applied to non-public
 * implementations of a public abstract class or interface, allowing developers to map these non-public types to their
 * public equivalents.<p/>
 *
 * A hypothetical example: if the private member class {@code java.util.Collections.EmptyList} was annotated with
 * {@code @PublicInterfaceRef(List.class)}, then a custom serialization framework that encodes objects using fully
 * qualified type names would be able to conveniently encode instances of {@code EmptyList} as "java.util.List" rather
 * than "java.util.Collections.EmptyList" (which is a hidden implementation detail not intended for public export).
